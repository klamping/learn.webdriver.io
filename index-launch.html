        <h2>A premium step-by-step guide to understanding Web App Testing.</h2>
        <h3>Learn to write Test Automation for Websites & Web Apps using WebdriverIO</h3>

      <h2>Automated testing isn't simple.</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="section-content">
      <h3>Websites are complex systems, and as a result, you need advanced tools to test them.</h3>

      <p>But too often this complexity turns into an overcomplicated solution.</p>

      <p>The truth is, <strong>there are no magical tools out there</strong> that can remove the overall complexity of testing websites, only ones that pretend to hide it behind bells and whistles.</p>

      <p>Tools are too often sold as antidotes to the complex nature of sites, promising to simplify testing to just a few actions.</p>

      <p>But <strong>we can't pretend the complexity doesn't exist</strong>. Because when you do, you end up with:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>Fragile tests that are constantly breaking with every update to the site</li>
          <li>Tests that are confusing to understand and nearly impossible to debug</li>
          <li>A test suite that's never run because it's too flakey and too difficult to integrate with the everyday processes of the team</li>
      </ul>

      <hr>

      <h2>How do I know this? I've lived it!</h2>

      <p>When I first started out, I thought that getting testing right was simply a matter of picking out the right tool for the job. So long as I got that right, I'd find success. </p>

      <p>But after going through tool after tool and never gaining any real value, I knew something was wrong. </p>

      <p>When I finally approached the problem with honesty, instead of searching for a non-existent magic solution, I understood that websites are complex and that's okay.</p>

      <p><img src="new/console.png" alt="Console output of successful tests" style="width: 100%;"></p>

      <h3>Once you understand that there is no "perfect" tool and that you have to solve the testing puzzle for yourself, you become empowered to make smart choices about where to focus your efforts, instead of trying to do everything all at once.</h3>

      <p>I used to write test after test after test, but no one would use them because they'd never consistently pass.</p>

      <p>I used to spend weeks trying to integrate my tests with a third-party tool that promised to make things easier, but it only added another layer of trouble.</p>

      <p>And after all this effort, **no one really cared**, because the tests were too fragile and too far removed from the development lifecycle.</p>

      <p><strong>When no one cares about the work you do... well, that's a scary place to be!</strong></p>

      <p>If someone handed you a screw and told you to join two pieces of wood together, you'd go looking for a screwdriver. While the screw is a simple machine, it still requires a specialized tool and a smart approach.</p>

      <p>If someone gave you a hammer, you'd look at them a little funny. Sure, the hammer would get the job done, but it would be messy and prone to failure. It's a short-term hack to something that needs a long-term vision.</p>

      <p>So why do we look at testing, which should require specialized tools and a smart approach, and think that we can just hammer on a solution that lasts?</p>

      <p>After shifting my approach from trying to find a magical tool which doesn't exist, to finding a tool that would allow me to take complex actions in simple ways, I was able to quickly narrow in on a choice: WebdriverIO.</p>

        <h2>WebdriverIO is the specialized tool I've chosen to take the smart approach to testing.</h2>

      <p>No, WebdriverIO isn't a magic wand that makes testing easy and fool-proof. Like I said, that just doesn't exist.</p>

      <p>But it is a full-featured toolset that enables you to quickly write tests in an organized manner that are much easier to update and maintain.</p>

      <p>It's like trading in your hammer for a power-drill. The hammer is a great short-term solution, but the drill is there for projects that need a quality approach.</p>

      <p>WebdriverIO quality approach contains:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>A streamlined setup to get you writing tests within minutes</li>
        <li>A robust Page Object framework for sturdier tests</li>
        <li>Integrations with popular tools, saving you weeks of time (and frustration)</li>
        <li>And honestly, a whole lot more than I can cover in a simple list...</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Once I started using WebdriverIO, I felt <strong>powerful</strong>, <strong>capable</strong> and most importantly, <strong>useful</strong>.</p>

          <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
      </div>

      <section class="faq">

        <h4>When will the course be ready?</h4>
        <p>Unfortunately, I can't give you a solid date on this. It's going to take a fair amount of work to complete, and with other priorities in my life (my kids), I can't promise anything specific. I do hope to have the first 10 videos released by Sept. 30th.</p>

        <h4>How much will it cost?</h4>
        <p>I again don't have an answer for you. I don't want to say one price and change it if the planned content is somehow different.</p>

        <h4>What prerequisites are there to this course?</h4>
        <p>You should have a good understanding of JavaScript and we'll be doing a little bit of work on the command line. While I don't cover the basics of JavaScript, I will provide links and a little bit of guidance on where you can freshen up your skills. Speaking of...</p>

        <p>If you're new to JavaScript, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=le-URjBhevE&list=PLWKjhJtqVAbk2qRZtWSzCIN38JC_NdhW5">check out this free course to get started</a>.</p>

        <p>If you haven't worked with the command line before, <a href="https://commandlinepoweruser.com/">here's another free course on the subject</a>.</p>

        <h4>I'm a front-end dev. Will this course be for me?</h4>
        <p>Absolutely. WebdriverIO is a perfect fit for anyone with a little bit of JavaScript knowledge looking to improve their skills through automated testing.</p>

        <h4>Are you available for online or in-person consulting?</h4>
        <p>Yep! <a href="https://www.codementor.io/kevinlamping">Reach out to me on CodeMentor.io for more details.</a></p>

        <h4>Will the videos be DRM free?</h4>
        <p>Absolutely. I trust you! There was that one jerk who stole my previous course content and uploaded it to a sketchy site, but the vast majority of y'all are good people and I won't punish you because there are jerks out there.</p>

        <h4>How will I access the course?</h4>
        <p>The course is hosted through <a href="">thinkific.com</a>, which is where you'll be able to access all the content indefinitely.</p>

        <h4>Will there be a student discount available?</h4>
        <p>Definitely!</p>

        <h4>What shell/terminal are you using in the videos??</h4>
        <p>Check out my personal "<a href="https://blog.kevinlamping.com/uses">Uses</a>" page for the info.</p>

        <h4>What if I don't like the content?</h4>
        <p>If you feel like the content isn't what you were expecting, I will have a "No Questions Asked" full refund policy for up to 30 days after purchase.</p>
